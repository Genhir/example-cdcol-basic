[**MvcCore**](https://github.com/mvccore/mvccore) classic CD collection CRUD example with default SQLite database.

Example uses SQLite database by default, but it contains also MySQL, MSSQL and PostgreSQL database backups, included in `./.databases/` directory.

This example is not a single file project application. If you want to see how to build a single file application with this example,  
run this example first (to see how it works) and then follow steps here on [`mvccore/example-cdcol-portable`](https://github.com/mvccore/example-cdcol-portable).

## Instalation
```shell
# load example
composer create-project mvccore/example-cdcol-basic

# go to project development dir
cd example-cdcol-basic/development

# update dependencies for app development sources
composer update
```
